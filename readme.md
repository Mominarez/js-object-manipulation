# Sculpture Script Assignment  

This project processes a list of sculptures and calculates the length of each string property in the dataset provided in data.js. <br> The script **sculptureScript.js** loops through each sculpture object, measuring the length of its **name**, **artist**, **description**, **url**, and **alt** values.  

## Sculpture List Lengths Output  

After running **sculptureScript.js**, the resulting **sculptureListLengths** object is:  
[
  { name: 26, artist: 20, description: 198, url: 31, alt: 90 }, <br>
  { name: 17, artist: 16, description: 188, url: 32, alt: 91 }, <br>
  { name: 16, artist: 19, description: 272, url: 31, alt: 98 }, <br>
  { name: 4, artist: 14, description: 169, url: 32, alt: 96 }, <br>
  { name: 9, artist: 20, description: 209, url: 32, alt: 98 }, <br>
  { name: 13, artist: 16, description: 235, url: 32, alt: 90 }, <br>
  { name: 9, artist: 21, description: 113, url: 32, alt: 94 }, <br>
  { name: 11, artist: 18, description: 254, url: 32, alt: 95 }, <br>
  { name: 15, artist: 14, description: 229, url: 31, alt: 92 }, <br>
  { name: 15, artist: 15, description: 332, url: 32, alt: 86 }, <br>
  { name: 7, artist: 15, description: 272, url: 32, alt: 98 }, <br>
  { name: 6, artist: 10, description: 78, url: 31, alt: 92 } <br>
